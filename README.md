📘 Students Depression Prediction Project
🎯 Project Overview
This project aims to predict depression in students using machine learning models based on various personal, academic, and behavioral features. The goal is to identify students who may be at risk of depression so that early intervention can be suggested.

🧠 Features & Functionality
Data Analysis & Visualization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations.
Visualizations for categorical and numerical features to identify patterns.
Machine Learning Prediction

Trains models to predict whether a student is Depressed or Not Depressed.
Supports multiple algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, or custom stacking models.
Handles feature preprocessing like encoding categorical data and scaling numerical data.
Interactive Interface (Optional)

Streamlit web app to input student information and get instant predictions.
Color-coded results:
✅ Not Depressed (green)
❌ Depressed (red)
